# 1. Dataset preparation unsing Python

## Overview
This task implements a dataset preparation pipeline for generating segmentation masks from the COCO dataset.

## Code Decisions and Edge Case Handling
- **Dataset Class:**  
  A custom PyTorch `Dataset` class (`COCOSegmentationDataset`) was implemented to load images and annotations from COCO and generate masks.
  
- **Mask Generation:**  
  - **Binary Masks:** Uses `np.maximum` to merge overlapping masks.
  - **Multi-class Masks:** Multiplies the binary mask with category indices to assign different values.
  
- **Error and Edge Case Handling:**  
  Overlapping masks are merged using `np.maximum` and annotations without a corresponding category are set to background (pixel value 0). Edge cases, such as potential annotation errors, are delegated to the COCO API but can be extended with additional exception handling.

### Example Image and Mask

Below are example outputs generated by the visualization script:

#  2. U-Net for Binary Image Segmentation
## Overview

A U-Net model was implemented using PyTorch to perform binary segmentation on images. The dataset used follows COCO-style formatting and includes custom binary masks for each object.

## Architecture
The U-Net architecture used includes:

- **Encoder**: Four downsampling blocks with double convolutions
- **Bottleneck**: A central block with 1024 channels
- **Decoder**: Four upsampling blocks using `ConvTranspose2D` and skip connections
- **Output**: 1-channel output with Sigmoid activation for binary mask prediction

##  Modeling Decisions

- **Simple U-Net from scratch**: Fast to implement and easy to debug.
- **Binary cross-entropy**: Best suited for binary segmentation.
- **Manual sigmoid output**: Makes training interpretable and helps with post-processing thresholding.
- **No data augmentation**: Initial training used raw images to benchmark baseline performance.

##  Challenges & Fixes

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Blurry masks | Switched from raw `torch.sigmoid` to explicitly using `nn.Sigmoid()` |
| Slow convergence | Added `torch.device()` GPU support |
| Overfitting | Tracking validation loss with early stopping (to be added) |
